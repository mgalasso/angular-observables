# To easily find the code, reference the app-routing-module to see which component is called for each menu item.

# RxJS Operator Definitions:

1. CONACT MAP: like a relay race : order matters : waits until all calls are finished.
2. MERGE MAP: starts at the same time but there is no order : fastest results show up first: use when params don't change
3. FORK JOIN: parent-child data
4. COMBINE LATEST: combine two or more streams to have one template pipe
5. ZIP: combine the latest values emitted by two or more observables into a single
